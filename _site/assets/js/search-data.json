This is detrimental to the performance of the robot which relies on consistent measurements from the sensor. We have patched and compiled the kernel with a fix for this specific sensor (MPU6050) that reduces the timeout to 10ms. You can find the file at our repo under kernel_patch. Steps to install the kernel are: . sudo mkdir /usr/src/kernel/kernel-4.9 cd /usr/src/kernel/kernel-4.9 wget https://github.com/jonah-gourlay44/gym2real/blob/main/kernel_patch.tbz2 tar -xvjf kernel_patch.tbz2 sudo cp -R /usr/src/kernel/kernel-4.9/build/modules/lib/modules/4.9.253-rt168 /lib/modules sudo cp /usr/src/kernel/kernel-4.9/build/kernel/arch/arm64/boot/Image /boot/Image.i2c_patch .
