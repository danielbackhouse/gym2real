## Overview

# Sim2Real

Gathering real-world data to train a robot can be costly and sample inefficient.

Sim2Real is a proposed solution to this problem and is the study of using simulated environments to train the behaviour of an agent before deploying it in the real-world.

The gap between simulated and real worlds determines the performance of the agent once transferred into real robots. 

There are no consistent set of tools hobbyists use to cross the sim2real gap.

# Solution

We used a two-wheel inverted pendulum (TWIP) robot, NVIDIA Jetson and isaac gym simulation tool  to create an open-source, standard set of software and hardware for better understanding the sim2real gap.
